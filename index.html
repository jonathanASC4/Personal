            I'm a computer science student at Johns Hopkins University (currently on the Dean's List!).
            I'm going to put filler text here because I can't think of what else to add without making
            this look like just an online resume. I guess I should tell you me interests.
            Uhhhhh I've been getting into DnD lately, that's pretty cool.

            look nice.
