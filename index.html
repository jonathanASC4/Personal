            I'm a computer science student at Johns Hopkins University (currently on the
            Dean's List!). I'm also studying mathematics and creative writing.

            My introduction to coding was
            <a href = "https://www.allstarcode.org/">All Star Code</a>.
            They've continues to help me with projects even after graduation, like my
            prototype of Trustworthy.

            With the help of ASC, I developed a working prototype of
            <a href = "https://oldtrustworthy.netlify.com/">Trustworthy</a>,
            an educational tool intended to promote the importance of fact-checking and
            skepticism towards unreliable sources. I presented it at ASC's five-year
            anniversary celebration.

            During the summer of 2018, I attended the
            <a href = "http://cooper.edu/engineering/summer-stem">Cooper Union Summer STEM
                Program</a>.
            In coordination with
            <a href = "https://www.jointhebloc.com/">BLOC</a>,
            I worked with a team of five to develop a prototype of
            <a href = "https://hireme.netlify.com/">Hire.me</a>,
            a web application that would connect students to career counselors.

            I take pictures of things on campus that I think look cool. Most of them aren't
            very good, but I think
            <a href = "https://photos.app.goo.gl/nG22Y31WQas3wWU19">some of them</a>
            look nice.
